Class

A class is like a blueprint or template.

It defines what an object should have (attributes/properties) and what it can do (methods/behaviors).

By itself, a class doesnâ€™t hold actual data â€” itâ€™s just a definition.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Think of Car as a class. It defines that cars have attributes like color, model, and methods like drive() or brake().

Object

An object is an instance of a class.

It is created from a class and holds real data.

You can create multiple objects from one class, each with different values.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

car1 = Car("red", "Tesla") â†’ This is one object.

car2 = Car("blue", "Toyota") â†’ This is another object.

Both car1 and car2 are objects of the Car class, but they hold different data.

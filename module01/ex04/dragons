In Fourth Wing, the first book of The Empyrean series, dragons are not just mythical 
creatures—they are intelligent, formidable beings that form soul-deep bonds with select 
humans known as dragon riders. These dragons are sentient, powerful, and fiercely independent, 
choosing their riders through a deadly and often unforgiving selection process 
at Basgiath War College. The bond between rider and dragon is sacred and unbreakable; 
if a rider dies, the dragon survives, but if a dragon dies, their rider typically perishes too, 
either from the psychic backlash or by choice. This connection forms the emotional and magical 
backbone of the series.

The dragons in Fourth Wing vary widely in type, power, and temperament. 
Some of the most notable include Tairn, a massive, black, ancient dragon 
bonded with Violet Sorrengail, the protagonist. Tairn is not only intimidating in 
size and reputation but also wise, deeply moral, and dryly humorous. He’s one of the 
rare few capable of wielding lightning, making him one of the most powerful dragons in the realm. 
Then there’s Andarna, a young golden dragon with mysterious powers, 
initially bonded with Violet as well in a rare occurrence called a dual bond. 
Andarna represents an unknown future for dragonkind—she’s the first of her kind in generations, 
hinting at ancient magic returning to the world.

Other dragons in the series include Sgaeyl, a fierce blue dragon bonded with Xaden Riorson. 
Sgaeyl is intensely loyal, strategic, and well-respected among her kind, 
and she mirrors Xaden's seriousness and strength. The color of a dragon in The Empyrean 
often correlates with their magical ability or elemental power: blacks and reds tend
 to wield lightning and fire, blues often lean toward strategy and speed, and golds like Andarna 
 may possess time-related powers, though that’s largely uncharted territory.

Dragons are also deeply political within their own society. They do not answer to humans, 
not even their bonded riders. They have their own hierarchies, rules, and motivations, 
and they act in accordance with what benefits dragonkind as a whole. This makes their 
involvement in human affairs more complex and often reluctant—unless they believe the cause 
is just or that their bonded rider’s survival depends on it. As the series unfolds, 
it becomes clear that the dragons may hold the key to ancient truths and forgotten powers 
that could reshape the balance of power in Navarre and beyond.

In The Empyrean, dragons are not background creatures or simple tools of war—they are central 
to the plot, the magic system, and the emotional arcs of the characters. They are majestic, 
fearsome, intelligent, and deeply woven into the fabric of the world, 
adding richness and depth to a story already brimming with tension, rebellion, and romance.

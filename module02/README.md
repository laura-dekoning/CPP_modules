From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. They will then implement the four required member
functions below:
â€¢ Default constructor
â€¢ Copy constructor
â€¢ Copy assignment operator
â€¢ Destructor

Orthodox Canonical Form:

Always pass your object by const references!!
1. Copy Constructor
ðŸ“Œ What it is

The copy constructor is called when you create a new object from an existing one.

	ClassName(const ClassName& other);

It gets a reference to another object of the same type and uses it to initialize the new one.

ðŸ“Œ When itâ€™s used

â€¢ Passing an object by value to a function
â€¢ Returning an object by value from a function
â€¢ Explicitly writing:

	ClassName b(a);   // calls copy constructor
	ClassName b = a;  // also calls copy constructor (not assignment!)

ðŸ“Œ Why you need it

If your class manages resources on the heap (like new-allocated memory, file handles, sockets), the compiler-generated copy constructor does a shallow copy â€” it just copies the raw pointer, not the data it points to.
That means two objects now share the same resource, and when both destructors run â†’ ðŸ’¥ double delete.

By writing your own copy constructor, you ensure a deep copy: allocate new resources and duplicate the contents.

2. Copy Assignment Operator
ðŸ“Œ What it is

The copy assignment operator is called when you already have an object and want to replace its contents with another.

	ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other);

It must return a reference to *this so you can chain assignments like a = b = c;.

ðŸ“Œ When itâ€™s used

	String a("hello");
	String b("world");
	b = a;   // copy assignment operator


Notice: here b already exists before the assignment.

ðŸ“Œ Why you need it

If you just copied the raw pointer (shallow copy), youâ€™d again have two objects pointing to the same memory. That leads to double frees and undefined behavior.

By writing your own copy assignment operator:

	1. You free the old resource of the left-hand object.
	2. You allocate new memory.
	3. You copy the content from the right-hand side.

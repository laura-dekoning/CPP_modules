HOW TO CALULATE BSP

We want to check if point P lies inside the triangle ABC.

The trick:
Compute total area of ABC → call this A.
Compute the areas of the 3 sub-triangles made with P:
PBC → A1
APC → A2
ABP → A3

If P is inside the triangle, then:

A=A1+A2+A3

If P is outside, the sum will be greater.
If P is exactly on an edge, one of A1, A2, or A3 will be 0.Graag

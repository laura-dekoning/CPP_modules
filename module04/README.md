1️⃣ What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism literally means “many forms.”

In C++ OOP, it’s the ability for a pointer or reference to a base class to call the correct derived class method at runtime, even if the base class type is used.

Base class defines a virtual function.

Derived classes override it.

At runtime, the program decides which function to call based on the actual type of the object, not the pointer type.

This is called runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.

Here:
- Animal defines the interface (makeSound) but cannot be instantiated.
- Cat and Dog override makeSound with their own implementation.


2️⃣ Showing polymorphism “in action”

Polymorphism works best with pointers or references to the base class:

int main() {
    Animal* animals[2];          // array of base-class pointers

    animals[0] = new Cat();      // Cat object
    animals[1] = new Dog();      // Dog object

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        animals[i]->makeSound(); // calls correct derived version
    }

    // cleanup
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
        delete animals[i];
}

Output:

Meow!
Woof!


Even though animals[i] is of type Animal*, C++ calls the correct Cat or Dog method at runtime because makeSound is virtual. ✅

3️⃣ Key points in C++

Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism.

Base pointers or references are used to refer to derived objects.

Must have a virtual destructor in the base class to avoid undefined behavior when deleting derived objects through a base pointer.

Polymorphism allows generic code — you can write functions that work on Animal* and handle any future derived classes automatically.

4️⃣ Example with deep copies and polymorphism

Using your deep-copy hierarchy:

Animal* animals[2];
animals[0] = new Cat(*static_cast<Cat*>(originalCat));
animals[1] = new Dog(*static_cast<Dog*>(originalDog));

for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
    animals[i]->makeSound();   // calls correct overridden method


Here you are both deep copying and showing polymorphism — the pointer type is Animal*, but each object acts like its actual derived type.
